Project Description:

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover valuable insights that can aid in decision-making for a retail business. The dataset includes key variables such as customer demographics, product categories, and transaction details, providing a comprehensive view of sales and customer behavior.

The primary goal is to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data that can inform business strategies. This involves cleaning the dataset, calculating descriptive statistics, analyzing time series data to identify sales trends, and examining customer and product behaviors. Visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps will be used to effectively present the insights.

Based on the findings, actionable recommendations will be provided to help the business optimize its operations, improve marketing strategies, and enhance customer engagement.
